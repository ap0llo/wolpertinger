          <p>Wolpertinger is remote file-access software for Windows that communicates over XMPP.</p>
          <p>
            However it was built with flexibility and extensibility in mind, so it can be easily adapted to accomplish other tasks as well as use communication protocols other than XMPP. 
          </p>
          <p>
           In it's current form, Wolpertinger uses XMPP to implement a fileserver-like application.
           However, there are several ways the core of Wolpertinger can be used for scenarios. At protocol-level, actual functionality offered by clients is encapsulted in components, so clients may implement additional components or leave out components they do not need. Furthermore, the protocol has no dependencies on XMPP, so any other protocol that can transmit text-messages in 2 directions can be used instead.
          </p>
          <h2>Implementations using the .NET library</h2>
          <p>
          The .NET library built for the reference implementation can be used to build other applications that communicate with each other using the wolpertinger protocol. New components can be added easily and as everything is loosly coupled, all core building blocks can be replaced with alternate implementations.

          Data Types can also added new types only need to implement a single interface to be used.
          </p>
          <h2>Using just the protocol</h2>
          <p>As the protocol is/will be fully documented, it is possible to create independet implementations for different target platforms with different component sets and other channels used to transmit messages. </p>
