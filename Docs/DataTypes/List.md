List===A List of objects. Objects can be of every type described here (both primitive and complex). The element itself contains "object" elements if it is a generic list or other elements if the item-type is known (has to be specified with the complex type that contains the list object).If the list contains primitive types, they always have to be wrapped into an object-element ###Example	<object type="list">		<object type="string">This is a string-example</object>		<object type="string">This is a second string</object>	</object>
